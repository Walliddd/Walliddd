A long-time player in the online world, fueled by a passion for gaming and content creation.  This led me to become the Italian Ambassador for Stumble Guys (by Scopely) and a moderator in their official Discord and Reddit communities.

Beyond community building, I'm a coding enthusiast with skills in Python, HTML, and CSS. Currently diving deeper into C++.
